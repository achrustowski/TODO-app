# TO-DO app

Simple to use TO-DO app written in C using Raylib 5 library. All UI components are made from scratch (i.e textbox, buttons) except for the icons.

## Currently still in progress:
- implement expandable textbox upon pressing 'Edit' icon
- when expanded, textbox will included details such as date created and date to be completed
- implement 'Clear All' button
- allow for saving/loading tasks

## Known bugs:
- text will overflow the textbox

## Stretch goals:
- stretch goal: multiple tabs/pages
- stretch goal: multiple users
